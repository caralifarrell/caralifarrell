# Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my Github!

My name is Cara-Li Farrell and I am currently a student at McGill University in Montreal 🇨🇦 where I am majoring in Business Analytics with a Concentration in Finance. I am passionate about learning data analytics ✨, especially visualization as it is a powerful tool for storytelling 📖, as well as improving my presentation skills by participating in various case competitions.

Outside of work and academics, I enjoy learning how to cook new dishes 🧑‍🍳, travel 🧳 (20+ countries), and learn new languages 💬 (I know English, French, and a bit of Italian and German). 

I would love to [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caralifarrell/) if you share any of the same interests as me!

Best,

Cara-Li
